# Wallabot-Project

## Objectives
* Use wallabot along with clasification algorithm (most likely bag of words / Neural Networks) in order to identify properties of the items and sort into groups

## Roadmap
* (Potentially) print a 3D mount for wallabot so we can accurately take measurements
* Compile a list of objects / items that we need for testing
* Begin creating the skeleton of the code that we will need to do this project
* Figure out how we are getting the data from Wallabot (look into Python libraries for Wallabot)
* Decide upon which classes (identifiers) we want to test for (will require us to actually look into the items)
* Understand the theoretics behind turning the output of the Wallabot into a form that we can use as input for a classification algorithm
